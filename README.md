# PAR-Labs

PAR is a subject of 3rd course of FIB (BarcelonaTech). This subject, Paralelism, has laboratories each week where we worked with theory concepts. We used **OMP** language, with **pragma**'s. All of these laboratories and their reports I made with my faculty mate called *Víctor Pérez Martos*; his Linkedin profile is [here](https://es.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%ADctor-p%C3%A9rez-500011109/en).

As I like to share my acquired knowledge, I leave here my repository for you can learn from it.

**Thank you** very much, and enjoy it!
